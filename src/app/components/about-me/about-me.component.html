            I am a {{ myAgeInYears }}-year-old German-speaking full-stack software developer with experience in
            developing web applications with Java, Spring Boot, Play, JavaScript/TypeScript & Angular.<br><br> In my
            spare time, I dedicated myself to
            an open source project in SQL out of self-interest and discovered my passion for programming. After trying a
            few programming languages, I realized that I really enjoyed web development with JavaScript.<br><br> So, in
            2021, I decided to become
            a software developer and take a project-based continuing education course. Here I worked on individual and
            group projects and was supported by experienced developers. Since then I was able to gain some experience
            and deepen my knowledge with
            various further education courses.<br> Since the beginning of 2023, I have been working for a German
            software company as a full-stack developer on the Java platform, working on exciting software projects every
            day.
