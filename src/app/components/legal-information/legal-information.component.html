    <h3 id="mOverview">Overview of Processing</h3>

    </ul>
    <h4>Categories of data subjects</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Communication partners.</li>

    <h4>Purposes of processing</h4>

    </ul>
    <h3 id="m13">Relevant Legal Bases</h3>
    <p>Below you will find an overview of the legal bases of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on which we
        process personal data. Please note that, in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection
        regulations in your or our country of residence or domicile may apply. If more specific legal bases are relevant
        in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the privacy policy.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Contractual Performance and Pre-contractual Inquiries (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is
            necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or for the implementation
            of pre-contractual measures requested by the data subject.</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate Interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is necessary to protect the
            legitimate interests of the data controller or a third party, unless the interests or fundamental rights and
            freedoms of the data subject, requiring the protection of personal data, prevail.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition to the data protection regulations of the General Data Protection Regulation, national regulations on
        data protection apply in Austria. This includes, in particular, the Federal Act concerning the Protection of
        Personal Data (Data Protection Act - DSG). The Data Protection Act contains special provisions, in particular,
        regarding the right to information, the right to rectification or erasure, the processing of special categories
        of personal data, processing for other purposes, transmission, and automated decision-making in individual
        cases.</p>
    <h3 id="m27">Security Measures</h3>
    <p>In accordance with legal requirements and considering the state of the art, implementation costs, the nature,
        scope, circumstances, and purposes of processing, as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the
        extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, we implement appropriate technical and
        organizational measures to ensure a level of protection commensurate with the risk.</p>
    <p>These measures include, in particular, securing the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data by
        controlling physical and electronic access to the data, as well as access, input, disclosure, availability, and
        separation thereof. Furthermore, we have established procedures to ensure the exercise of data subjects' rights,
        the deletion of data, and responses to data threats. Additionally, we consider the protection of personal data
        during the development or selection of hardware, software, and procedures, following the principles of data
        protection, through technical design and privacy-friendly settings.</p>
    <p>TLS Encryption (https): To protect the data transmitted via our online offering, we use TLS encryption. You can
        recognize such encrypted connections by the prefix https:// in the address bar of your browser.</p>
    <h3 id="m12">Data Deletion</h3>
    <p>The data processed by us will be deleted in accordance with legal requirements as soon as the consent for
        processing, which is allowed for processing, is revoked, or other permissions are no longer valid (e.g., when
        the purpose of processing this data has ceased to exist or they are no longer necessary for the purpose). If the
        data is not deleted because it is required for other purposes that are legally permissible, its processing will
        be limited to these purposes. This means that the data will be blocked and not processed for other purposes.
        This applies, for example, to data that must be retained for commercial or tax reasons or whose storage is
        necessary for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or to protect the rights of another natural or
        legal person.</p>
    <p>Our privacy notices may also provide additional information on the storage and deletion of data that is primarily
        applicable to the respective processing activities.</p>
    <h3 id="m182">Contact and Inquiry Management</h3>
    <p>When contacting us (e.g., via contact form, email, phone, or social media) and within existing user and business
        relationships, the information of the inquiring individuals is processed to the extent necessary to respond to
        contact inquiries and any requested actions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Processed Data Types:</strong> Contact data (e.g., email, phone numbers); Content data (e.g.,
            entries in online forms); Usage data (e.g., visited web pages, interest in content, access times);
            Meta-/communication data (e.g., device information, IP addresses).</li>
        <li><strong>Data Subjects:</strong> Communication partners.</li>
        <li><strong>Purposes of Processing:</strong> Contact inquiries and communication; Management and response to

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Contact Form:</strong> When users contact us via our contact form, email, or other communication
            channels, we process the information provided in this context to handle the stated request; <strong>Legal
